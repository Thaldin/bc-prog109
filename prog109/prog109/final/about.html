                My name is Ed Abshire.  I'm a native Southern California for almost 21 years before I left.  After spending three years in
                San Antonio, TX for the U.S. Air Force, I moved up to Washington state.  I have now lived in WA almost 20 years.  <br />
                For work, I have been a developer for over 25 years.  I am a father of one and have two cats (Mitchell and Spaz)
                and two dogs (Bear and Tonka).

                <h3>Home</h3>
                This is the area where I would tell you about the stuff I like to do at home.  I enjoy table top and computer gaming.  I also
                like to tinker with my C# development skills.  During the summer, I like to get outside and go hiking and camping.

                <h3>Work</h3>
                After doing various random jobs, in 1995 I joined the United States Air Force.  I spent three years being a developer in the USAF.
                I worked on mainframes, SGI Unix servers, and various other small systems and projects.  Then I worked for Microsoft for 7 years.
                After Microsoft, I left and went to a small company that ended up being bought and now I work for Visa.

                <h3>School</h3>
                In 2015, I decided that I would stop putting it off and went back to school to get my Bachelor's Degree.  At this point, as of Winter
                2018, I have finished up my Associate's Degree.  I have been accepted to the University of Washington's Bothell campus and start
                in Spring 2018 to complete my Bachelor's Degree.
